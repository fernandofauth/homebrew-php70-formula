# Homebrew php@7.0 Formula

After Homebrew remove the php@7.0 formula prematurely, I undertood that other developer, like me will need this feature to keep using 7.0 version.
So, this is a simple tutorial with file to install the formula in you MAC .

## Installation

Download file ` php@7.0.rb ` and move this to you Homebrew Formulas folder.
My default path is this one

```
/usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-core/Formula/
```

## Usage

After that you will able to run ` brew install php@7.0 ` again .
If you have some trouble to link with this version, you can use this command.
```
brew link php@7.0 --force --overwrite
```
